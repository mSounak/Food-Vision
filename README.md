# Food-Vision üçú üì∏

Built an end-to-end **CNN Image Classification Model** which identifies the food in your image.

I have used an pre-trained Image Classification Model, EfficientNetB0, previously pre-trained on ImageNet, that comes with Tensorflow and then retrained it on [Food 101 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41) dataset.

## Fun Fact

This model actually beats the [DeepFood](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05675) Paper's model which also trained on the same dataset.

The Accuracy of DeepFood was **77.4%** and our models is **79%**. It is not much but, we take those.


## How can you use it?

Finally after training the model, I have exported as `.h5` files and then integrated it with **Streamlit Web App**

### Try it out yourself, [Click Here!](https://what-you-eating.heroku.com)

Once the app is loaded,

1. Choose the input type. Whether you want to upload an image or enter URL of an image
2. For upload an image option, choose image from your computer.
3. For URL option, erase the existing url and enter your own url and press enter
4. Once you have done the above, the model will predict the output and display the **Top-5 Predictions**



### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mSounak/Food-Vision
   ```
2. install `requirements.txt`
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. run app.py
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
